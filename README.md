## InstagramUploader

### What is this? 

This is a discontinued project of mine to create a web service for uploading photos to instagram. This code allows you to bulk upload multiple files to Instagram at once.

### It doesn't work anymore!

If it suddenly stops working, you need to extract the new signature key from the instagram app. A pretty good write up on that is found [here](https://mokhdzanifaeq.github.io/extracting-instagram-signature-key-2/) and [here](https://mokhdzanifaeq.github.io/extracting-instagram-signature-key/)

### Documentation 

I lost it all, sorry. Will attempt to rewrite it.

### Examples

Test using my web app [here](https://andrew.im/instagram/)

Or check my test account [here](https://www.instagram.com/automationbot/)

### Why does it need a password?

Because this uses the same API calls as the official app, which uses your password. I was reverseing OAuth to allow for uploading but never got to finishing it. 

### It gives me a media id but there is no image on my account

Congratulations, your account now requires you to solve a captcha to upload.
